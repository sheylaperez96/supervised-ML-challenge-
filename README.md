#Unit 19 Homework: Predicting Credit Risk

In this assignment, I will be building a machine learning model that attempts to predict whether a loan will be approved or not.



Lending services companies allow individual investors to partially fund personal loans as well as buy and sell notes backing the loans on a secondary market. This data will be used to
You will be using this data to create machine learning models to classify the risk level of given loans. Specifically, you will be comparing the Logistic Regression model and Random Forest Classifier.

In this assignment, I built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

Instructions
Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.
Display the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.
Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.
